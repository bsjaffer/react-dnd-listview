# react-dnd-listview
React DND listview with webpack,ES6

### Install from source

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bsjaffer/react-dnd-listview.git
```

Then install dependencies and check to see it works

```bash
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm run start                     # Compile and launch
```
If everything works, you should listview in a hierarchy form and DND will work on mobile.

By changing  the DragDropContext it can be used in browsers too.
